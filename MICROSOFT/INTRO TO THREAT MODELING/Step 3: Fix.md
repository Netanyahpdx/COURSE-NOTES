# STEP 3: FIX #

The fix phase is where the fate of all threats is decided. Each STRIDE threat maps to 1 or more security controls, which offer different functions and types to choose from.

---

**GOALS**

- Measure each threat against a prioritization framework or security bug bar.
- Track each threat as a task or work item in a bug-management service.
- Generate security control recommendations that are mapped to STRIDE threats
- Address each threat by selecting one or more security control types and functions.
= Resolve tasks.

IMPORTANT: If you don't complete this phase, you won't find the security controls to help reduce risk or track each threat properly.

**SET UP A THREAT TRACKING WORKFLOW**  
   
Set up a threat tracking workflow that prioritizes threats and creates tasks to address them.

**PRIORITIZE THREATS**  
  
Start by measuring each threat against a prioritization framework or security bug bar. This process helps you arrange resources to fix issues deemed most important to your organization.  
  
The process uses 3 key variables:

TIP: Microsoft engineers use an internal security bug bar that assigns threats with a Critical, Important, Moderate, Low, or Information severity rating. Check with your security team to confirm how to prioritize your issues.

**CREATE TASKS**  
  
Next, add each threat in a bug management solution like Azure DevOps Services.   
Some of the benefits include:  
- Reinforces issue ownership  
- Effectively tracks history  
- Gives you the ability to use standardized templates for priority and resolution exercises

**RATE SECURITY CONTROL EFFECTIVENESS & COST**  
   
Visit each security control recommendation mapped to STRIDE threats. Write down the ones that are most effective and least expensive to implement.  
  
Here are a few examples:

TIP: You might come across security controls that reduce or completely eliminate multiple threats at once. As an example, using SSL/TLS creates secure transmission channels to help prevent malicious data modification or disclosure.

**SECURITY CONTROL TYPES & FUNCTIONS**  
   
Security controls have different types and functions. When combined, they help secure your system and create multiple layers of security, also known as *defense-in-depth*.

You can choose 1 or more security control types: 
- Physical (cameras)  
- Technical (encryption)  
- Administrative (policies)
     
These types have 1 or more security control functions:

**ADD SECURITY CONTROL DETAILS TO EACH ISSUE**
 
Add the details to each issue in the bug management solution, then resolve each issue with 1 of the following resolutions.   
They vary slightly from organization to organization:

**CHECK YOUR KNOWLEDGE**
1. What happens at the Fix Phase? 
It's when you generate, validate, and prioritize a list of security controls to reduce or eliminate risk.
