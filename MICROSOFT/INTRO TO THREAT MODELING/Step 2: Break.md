# STEP 2: BREAK #

The break phase is where you use the data flow diagram to find potential threats against your system.
The process uses a threat modeling framework to help you find the most common threats and ways to protect
against them.

**GOALS**  
  
- Choose between *protecting the system* and *understanding the attacker* focused approaches  
- Use the STRIDE framework to identify common threats  
  
IMPORTANT: If you don't complete this phase, you won't find potential threats in your system, which can lead to future breaches.

**FOCUS YOUR APPROACH**  
  
Start by choosing whether you want to find ways to protect your system, or you want to understand all you can about an attacker and their motives.   
Examples include:

NOTE: Microsoft product engineers mostly focus on protecting the system. Penetration testing teams focus on both.

**SELECT A THREAT FRAMEWORK**  
  
Next, select a framework to help generate potential threats in your system. Microsoft traditionally uses STRIDE, an acronym for the 6 main threat categories to provide an extensive—but not exhaustive—list of threats.  
  
The framework helps you ask a few important questions about your system:

**CHECK YOUR KNOWLEDGE**  
1. What happens at the Break Phase?  
- You select a focus area with an associated framework to systematically identify potential solutions for your system.
