Enhancing security is of utmost importance to every organization, as is protecting valuable data and sensitive information, such as bank details, personal information, financial, and medical records, and so on.  
Organizations deal with large amounts of critical data and personal information.  
Also, the systems and users within an organization operate in different environments, such as on premises, cloud, or hybrid.  
With highly sophisticated cybercriminals waiting to take advantage of any security lapse, it's critical to use Zero Trust as the best defense against cyberattacks and threats.  
As the name implies, Zero Trust works on the premise of "never trust, always verify".  
This implies that all users, within or outside the corporate network, must authenticate, authorize, and routinely validate before they access resources.
