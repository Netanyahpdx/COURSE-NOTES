## CRYPTOGRAPHY AND THE PUBLIC KEY INFRASTRUCTURE ##

**CRYPTOGRAPHY:** The study of writing or solving codes. 

**(PKI) PUBLIC KEY INFRASTRUCTURE:** The implementation of cryptology on a computer network. It's an infrastructure composed of hardware, software, policy & procedures that facilitates the management of public digital keys and makes cryptography over a network and the internet possible.

# ENCRYPTION, DIGITAL SIGNING AND RELEVANT TERMS ##

**ENCRYPTION:** Converting plaintext to crypto text, in other words making something that was readable, unreadable.  
  
**DIGITAL SIGNATURE:** Also uses cryptography to produce a unique value that can be tied to a person. In most jurisdictions, a digital signature is legally equivalent to a hand-written signature.  

**_Encryption_ and using a _digital signature_ satisfy a number of objectives:**  
- **_ENCRYPTION_** ensures that information remains private and confidential.
- A **_DIGITAL SIGNATURE_** guarantees the integrity and authenticity of the data.
- A **_DIGITAL SIGNATURE_** can be used to identify or authenticate an entity.
- **_A DIGITAL SIGNATURE_** can also ensure non-repudiation.
    - _**NON-REPUDIATION*__ has legal implications and means that the signee cannot deny having signed the information. If the information is a legal contract, the signee is bound to the contract because of their digital signature.

By satisfying these 4 terms:  

- **CONFIDENTIALITY**
- **DATA INTEGRITY**
- **AUTHENTICATION**
- **NON-REPUDIATION**

_**CRYPTOGRAPHY**_ has facilitated the rise of e-commerce and secure communications.
