# LESSON 1: SOCIAL ENGINEERING OVERVIEW #

What is social engineering?   
Understood in the context of information security, it is the act of manipulating people
to gain advantage, often at the expense of those targeted.
- All social engineering attacks are designed to benefit the attacker.
- Most successful social engineering attacks are detrimental to their victims.
- Social engineering attacks can result in a loss of confidential data, blackmail or
embezzlement, disruption or damage to a network, the denial of network services, the alignment of the target’s opinion with the attacker’s as a result of manipulation, or some combination of all of these outcomes.
- There are many different methods being both physical & digital.
- Some examples of those methods include:
  - A bad actor convincing a target to allow them access to a restricted area
  - An email sent to a target convincing them to click a provided link.
In both examples, manipulation is the means used to get the desired action from the targeted individual.
- Social engineering works because people are vulnerable to manipulation.
- How do you protect yourself from such attacks?
    - By being educated about and more alert to social engineering techniques, you will be less likely to fall victim to this type of attack.
