# LESSON 5: FRAUD, SCAMS & INFLUENCE CAMPAIGNS #

**CYBER FRAUD:** A social engineering technique, malware, or other type of deception that is
used to defraud or take advantage of a person or organization for financial or personal gain.

**CYBER SCAM:** A type of fraud, but they are generally classified as petty or not as serious as cyber fraud.   
According to the FBI, elderly Americans lose more than $3B annually to various types of scams.  
Senior citizens are often targeted because they are more trusting than younger adults and they have a lifetime of savings to prey upon.

Fraud and scams are criminal activities that use the same threat vectors as previously discussed. 

EXAMPLES: 
- **COPYCAT GOVERNMENT WEBSITES:** Bad actors use phishing, spear phishing, or other variant to provide a link to a fake government site, usually with the intention of stealing the user’s credentials or credit card information.
- **DATING & ROMANCE SCAMS:** Bad actors leverage legitimate dating websites, social networks, and chat rooms to get personal details or money from people.
- **HOLIDAY FRAUD:** Bad actors offer customers online holidays and accommodations that are not available or do not exist. 
- **MANDATE FRAUD:** A bad actor hacks an email transaction, such as one between a customer and a vendor. The bad actor then, sends a duplicate invoice with the bad actor’s bank account information, and requests payment.  
- **PHARMING:** Bad actors redirect traffic from a legitimate website to a fake one, such as an e-commerce or banking site. 
- **GREETING CARD SCAMS:** Sending a malicious greeting card to a person on their birthday, or during an important holiday, such as Christmas or Easter.

**INFLUENCE CAMPAIGNS:** Large scale efforts to shift public opinion. 
Such campaigns are generally executed in bad faith and seek to promote a false narrative. 
These campaigns are often carried out by groups with high levels of capability, up to and including nation-state actors.

**HOW INFLUENCE CAMPAIGN WORKS:**
1. The bad actor creates fake user accounts on social media platforms. 
2. The bad actor creates content to promote a given narrative.
3. They post this content as fake userson numerous social media sites.
4. Real people see the content and begin to share it. 
5. After reaching a certain threshold, mass media picks up the story, further amplifying the narrative.

- This is the strength of influence campaigns.  
- With little cost and effort, the bad actor can manipulate the opinions of hundreds of thousands of people.   
- The nature of social media allows the bad actor to operate secretly and without fear of being identified as the source of the attack.
- Publicly attacking an adversary is likely to result in undesirable consequences, but secretly turning public opinion against them is harder to prove and harder to retaliate against.


**SCENARIO:**   
2 restaurant owners are bitter rivals.   
Restaurant owner A uses anonymous social media accounts to spread disinformation about restaurant owner B.   
Restaurant owner A claims that restaurant owner B refused to hire an individual based on that individual’s race.   
Others jump onto social media, demand retribution, and boycott the restaurant.   
If restaurant owner B accuses their rival of circulating lies, this could easily backfire and further provoke the virtue-signaling mob.   
Regardless of what restaurant owner B does (remains silent, denies the accusation, or accuses their rival of foul play) it’s a losing proposition.  

On the other hand, if someone openly makes a false claim or accusation, then the victim can take legal recourse, putting the reputation of the accuser at stake.  
Influence campaigns can also be a part of hybrid warfare, as conducted by “psyops”, a division of the military.  
In this scenario, traditional warfare tactics are combined with political strategy and cyber warfare, which can include hacking, social engineering, influence campaigns, and promoting fake news.   
In hybrid warfare, the objective of influence campaigns is to weaken the enemy’s resolve by sowing confusion and division.

2. Indicate the steps of an online influence campaign in the correct sequence:
- Make user accounts on social media
