To better understand and defend against cyberattacks, it is helpful to examine the various frameworks that have
been developed to classify and analyze them. These frameworks provide a structure for identifying the different
stages of attack, discerning the different tactics used during those stages, analyzing their impact, and developing
strategies for prevention and response.

Attack frameworks were developed in response to cyberattacks that were more sophisticated and protracted than
in the past. These types of attacks, which can involve extended periods of surveillance and planning before
methodically attacking a targeted computer network, are often referred to as advanced persistent threats (APTs).
While attack frameworks embody extensive knowledge about attackers’ tactics and techniques, they are more
than a knowledge base. Rather, you should view attack frameworks as a toolbox for cybersecurity professionals to
enhance an organization’s security posture.

## 2 EXAMPLES OF CYBERATTACK FRAMEWORKS: ##
1. **LOCKHEED MARTIN'S CYBER KILL CHAIN**
  -More widely used. Developed by Lockheed Martin in 2011. It's a 7 step model that describes the stages of a cyberattack, from the initial reconnaissance and weaponization of the attack method to the final exploitation and exfiltration of data. 

2. **MITRE ATT&CK**
  -The Mitre corporation published the adversaries  tactics, techniques, and common knowledge or MITRE
ATT&CK guideline. The guideline classified and described cyberattacks and intrusions. So, like the Cyber Kill
Chain, it will help you to understand the attacker’s methodology, but MITRE is more than that. 
It is a constantly evolving resource that provides a common language and approach for understanding and mitigating cyberattacks.
The matrix is organized into a series of "techniques" that describe specific tactics and methods used by attackers
to compromise systems and steal or manipulate information. These techniques are grouped into categories based
on the type of attack or activity being performed, such as "Initial Access", "Execution", and "Defense Evasion”.
One of the key benefits of the MITRE ATT&CK matrix is that it provides a common language and framework for
discussing and analyzing cyber threats. This allows organizations to communicate and coordinate their efforts to
prevent and respond to attacks more effectively. The matrix also helps organizations to identify and prioritize the
most critical threats and vulnerabilities by mapping them to the appropriate techniques and categories.
The matrix is also a valuable resource for security professionals because it provides a comprehensive overview of
the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by attackers. This allows security teams to better understand
the methods and motivations of attackers, and to design and implement countermeasures to prevent or mitigate
attacks more effectively.

##**LOCKHEED MARTIN'S CYBER KILL CHAIN:**##
**1. RECONNAISSANCE:** The attacker gathers information about the target and its vulnerabilities.  
This may involve using tools such as search engines, social media, and other open sources to gather intelligence about the target organization and its systems.
**2. WEAPONIZATION:** The attacker creates a payload or exploit that can be delivered to the target.  
This may involve creating malware or other malicious code, such as a virus or Trojan horse, and packaging it in a way that is difficult to detect. For example, this could be an innocuous-looking but infected Microsoft Word document that is intended to be delivered by way of a phishing email.
**3. DELIVERY:** The attacker delivers the payload to the target. This may involve sending an
email with a malicious attachment, or exploiting a vulnerability in a website to inject the payload into the target's
system.
**4. EXPLOITATION:** The attacker uses the payload to gain access to the target's systems or data. This may involve executing the payload to exploit a vulnerability in the target's software or operating system, or using the payload to gain access to the target's network.
**5. INSTALLATION:** The attacker establishes a foothold within the target's systems.   
This may involve installing a rootkit or other malicious software that allows the attacker to maintain access to the target's systems even if the initial payload is detected and removed.
**6. COMMAND AND CONTROL:** The attacker establishes a means of communication with the compromised systems. This may involve setting up a command-and-control server or using other methods to communicate with the compromised systems remotely.
**7. EXFILTRATION:** The attacker extracts the data or other assets that were the goal of the attack. This may involve copying sensitive data to a remote location or using the compromised systems to launch further attacks on other targets.
  
Lockheed Martin’s Kill Chain has done much to advance the understanding of the incremental stages of a
cyberattack. However, it makes some assumptions that reduce its effectiveness. One major disadvantage of the
Cyber Kill Chain is that it assumes that the origin of an attack is external to the network. Also, the kill chain
methodology aims to reinforce traditional defense methods. Other cyberattack frameworks arose, in part, because
of limitations in the Cyber Kill Chain.

## KEY TERMS: ##
**PAYLOAD:**  Malicious code. Originally, it referred to the load carried by a truck, airplane or missile. 
**ROOTKIT:** Software used by bad actors to gain control over a targeted computer or network.
