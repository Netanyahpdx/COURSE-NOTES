# LESSON 3: CYBERSECURITY THREATS #

**CYBERSECURITY THREAT:**   
An action exploiting a vulnerability that results in harm to a network or computer system. Bad actors are the instigators of cybersecurity threats. They exploit different attack vectors to achieve their goals. 

---

**ATTACK VECTOR:**   
Method used by a bad actor to illegally access or inhibit a network, system or facility. 

- **3 COMPONENTS OF AN ATTACK VECTOR:**  
      1. Vulnerability.  
      2. Mechanism or object that exploits the vulnerability.  
      3. The pathway to the vulnerability.  
      
- **ATTACK VECTORS > THREATS**  

- **Attack vectors can be divided into:**
  - Electronic Social Engineering 
  - Physical Social Engineering
  - Technical Vulnerabilities (computer misconfiguration)

---

**METHOD:** 
How a vulnerability is exploited. 

---

**ATTACK PATH:**
Preparation of an attack campaign. 
The chain of events that occurs when attack vectors are exploited.

EXAMPLES: 

  
**SCENARIO:** Diego receives an email from a colleague asking him to review an attached document. He saves the doc to his HD and opens it. Diego didnt know that the sender wasn't really his colleague. The document installed malware onto his computer.
**VULNERABILITY** = user
**MECHANISM** = malware & socially engineered message that convinced him to download the document
**PATHWAY** = email

**SCENARIO:** An  authorized person is entering a server room which is a restricted zone. He notices a technician laden with boxes and computer equipment loitering outside. She explains that she needs to upgrade some equipment, but forgot her access pass. The authorized person doesn't recognize her, but since she sounds convincing, he wants to be helpful so he opens the door and she passes through. While in the server room, she discretely connects a USB device to one of the servers that installs malware. 
**VULNERABILITY** = the authorized person who let them in, and an unprotected server.
**MECHANISM** = malware and the situation used to convince the man to allow her access to the server room. 
**PATHWAY** = Door into server room and the USB device that released the malware. 
**ATTACK VECTORS** = Access to facility, access to server room
Server infection was merely the 1st stage in a chain of events that may include reconnaissance and the exfiltration of data.
