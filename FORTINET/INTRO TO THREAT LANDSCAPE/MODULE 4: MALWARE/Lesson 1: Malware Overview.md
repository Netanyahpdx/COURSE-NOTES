# LESSON 1: MALWARE OVERVIEW #


**MALWARE / MALICIOUS SOFTWARE:** Disrupts, damages, or gains unauthorized access to a computer. 
MALWARE GOAL:
- Modifying the behavior of a program
- Spying on people using the infected computer
- Exfiltrating data
- Encrypting important information and then demanding a ransom
- Denying users access to a system.  
The purpose of each type of malware depends on the objectives of bad actors.  
An attack campaign may use multiple types of malware that are designed to complete specific tasks at each stage of the attack.
Understanding the different types of malware, their characteristics, and their uses, will help you to prepare for cyberattacks against your computer and network. 


A **virus** is that it is not self-activated; in other words, it requires a user to invoke it. 
A **worm** self-activates and does not need a user to invoke it on the targeted computer. 
**Ransomware** denies users access to information, usually by encrypting it. 
**Spyware** reports user behavior to an external party. Each malware type has different traits and purposes.
