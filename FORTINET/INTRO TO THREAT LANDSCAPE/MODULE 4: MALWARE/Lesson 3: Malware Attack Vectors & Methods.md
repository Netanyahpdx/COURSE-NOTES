# LESSON 3: MALWARE ATTACK VECTORS & METHODS #


**ATTACK VECTOR / THREAT VECTOR:** A method that a bad actor uses to illegally access or inhibit a network, system, or facility.  
An attack vector can refer either to a specific method of attack, or to a category of attack.
-Ex: Social engineering is a category of attack vector, and it consists of many attack types. 

Attack vector has three components: 
- **VULNERABILITY**  
- **MECHANISM**  
- **PATHWAY:** Enables a mechanism to access the target.  

**ATTACK VECTOR:** The method used to attack a target.  
**ATTACK SURFACE:** Represents the total number of entry points that the vector creates to gain unauthorized access to the target. *(It can expand or contract due to circumstances.)*

In this graphic, the targeted person is the attack surface and is exposed to various assassination
methods. The entire individual is the attack surface. The person could reduce their vulnerability, or attack surface, by wearing a helmet and Kevlar vest. In another example, a password policy requirement is a factor in the attack surface. More stringent password requirements cause the attack surface to contract, and lenient requirements cause the attack surface to expand. One of the objectives of IT security is to reduce the attack surface of the network.

Although attack vectors can be physical or electronic, this lesson focuses on only attack vectors involving malware.  
Social engineering attacks infect computers with different types of malware, as seen in the previous
lesson. 

**MALWARE ATTACK VECTORS:**
- **WATERING HOLES:** Pathways that bridge mechanisms to vulnerabilities. For example, a bad actor compromises a digital meeting place. Users are more vulnerable to manipulation in a familiar environment such as a social media site, so they are more likely to click on links or download an amusing cat video that serves as a Trojan horse for malware

Malware takes control of a computer, making it into a robot, or bot for short. Another term for bot is zombie. The bad actor controls the computer using a command-and-control (C&C) server, which sends commands to systems compromised by bot malware, and then receives stolen data. A collection of computers controlled by a C&C server is called a botnet. Botnets can have many purposes, for example, to harvest information from infected machines, to send spam and phishing emails, or to attack web services. An attack by a botnet against a server with the intent of making it  inaccessible is known as a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. In this case, the
mechanis


When a bad actor finds a pathway to a vulnerability, they can install malware or deploy a malicious mechanism.

Here are some examples of clandestine mechanisms and exploitation methods used by bad actors:
A backdoor is an unauthorized way of gaining access to a computer.

A logic bomb is a piece of malicious code left lying in wait on a computer that will execute under specific
conditions.
An Easter egg is a hidden feature or a piece of code left behind by developers. In some cases, an Easter egg can
leave your network and data exposed to bad actors.
Droppers are programs designed to extract other files from their own code. Typically, droppers extract several
files onto a computer to install a malicious program package. Droppers can also have other functions.
A downloader is a type of Trojan horse that installs itself on a computer, and waits until an internet connection
becomes available to connect to a remote server or website. It then downloads additional programs (usually
malware) onto the infected computer.
Shellcode is a set of instructions in software that execute a command to take control of or exploit, a compromised
computer.
Code injection is the term used to describe attacks that inject code into an application. The injected code is
interpreted by the application, changing the way a program executes. Code injection attacks typically exploit an
application vulnerability that allows the processing of invalid data.
