# LESSON 3: MALWARE ATTACK VECTORS & METHODS #


**ATTACK VECTOR / THREAT VECTOR:**   
A method that a bad actor uses to illegally access or inhibit a network, system, or facility.  
   
**ATTACK VECTOR CAN REFER TO:**
- A specific method of attack
- A category of attack: Social engineering
-Ex: Social engineering is a category of attack vector, and it consists of many attack types. 

---

Attack vector has three components: 
- **VULNERABILITY**  
- **MECHANISM**  
- **PATHWAY:** Enables a mechanism to access the target.  

**ATTACK VECTOR:** The method used to attack a target.  
   
**ATTACK SURFACE:** Represents the total number of entry points that the vector creates to gain unauthorized access to the target. *(It can expand or contract due to circumstances.)*  

---

A password policy requirement is a factor in the attack surface. More stringent password requirements cause the attack surface to contract, and lenient requirements cause the attack surface to expand. One of the objectives of IT security is to reduce the attack surface of the network.

Although attack vectors can be physical or electronic, this lesson focuses on only attack vectors involving malware.  
Social engineering attacks infect computers with different types of malware, as seen in the previous lesson.

**MALWARE ATTACK VECTORS:**  
  
**WATERING HOLES:**  
- **VULNERABILITY:** The user
- **PATHWAY:** Watering hole
- **MECHANISM:** The malware

---

Malware takes control of a computer, making it into a *__robot__*, or *__bot__* for short. (*Another term for bot is *__zombie__*.)*      
The bad actor controls the computer using a command-and-control (C&C) server, which sends commands to systems compromised by bot malware, and then receives stolen data.  
A collection of computers controlled by a C&C server is called a **_botnet_**.  
Botnets can have many purposes:  
    - To harvest information from infected machines  
    - To send spam and phishing emails  
    - To attack web services.  
An attack by a botnet against a server with the intent of making it  inaccessible is known as a **_distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack._**  

-**VULNERABILITY:** Server
-**PATHWAY:** Internet
-**MECHANISM:** Malware (botnet)

When a bad actor finds a pathway to a vulnerability, they can install malware or deploy a malicious mechanism.  

**Here are some examples of clandestine mechanisms and exploitation methods used by bad actors:**  

- **BACKDOOR:**  
An unauthorized way of gaining access to a computer.

- **LOGIC BOMB:**  
A piece of malicious code left lying in wait on a computer that will execute under specific conditions.  

- **EASTER EGG:**  
A hidden feature or a piece of code left behind by developers. *(In some cases, an Easter egg can leave your network and data exposed to bad actors.)*

- **DROPPERS:**  
Programs designed to extract other files from their own code. Typically, droppers extract several files onto a computer to install a malicious program package. Droppers can also have other functions.

- **DOWNLOADER:**  
A type of *__Trojan horse__* that installs itself on a computer, and waits until an internet connection becomes available to connect to a remote server or website. It then downloads additional programs (usually malware) onto the infected computer.

- **SHELLCODE:**  
A set of instructions in software that execute a command to take control of or exploit, a compromised computer.

- **CODE INJECTION:**  
The term used to describe attacks that inject code into an application. The injected code is interpreted by the application, hanging the way a program executes. Code injection attacks typically exploit an application vulnerability that allows the processing of invalid data.
