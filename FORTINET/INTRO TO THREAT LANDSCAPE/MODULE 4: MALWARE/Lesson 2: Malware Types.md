# LESSON 2: MALWARE TYPES #


**COMMON SYMPTOMS OF COMPUTER INFECTION:**
- Computing devices suddenly become sluggish or unresponsive.
- Unwanted pop-up windows appear in an application or web browser. *(These are telltale signs that malware, virus, or spyware is affecting your device.)*
- Applications unexpectedly close by themselves. *(This likely means that the software has been infected with some form of virus or malware.)*
- Applications fail to load when selected from the Start menu or desktop icon. *(Computer malware causes computers to act in a variety of strange ways, which may include opening files by themselves, displaying unusual error messages, or entering characters randomly.)*
- Applications crash or log the user out.
- System crashes and the computer itself inexplicably shutting down.
- Emails in your outlook that you didn’t send. *(Hackers use other people's email accounts to spread malware and carry out wider cyberattacks. Emails in your outbox that you didn’t send can be a sign of an infection.)*
- Unexplained changes to a computer *(Your system’s homepage being modified or your browser settings being updated, are signs of the presence of malware.)*

**MALWARE:** Malicious software that disrupts, damages, or gains unauthorized access to a computer system.

**VIRUS:** Malware with additional traits. Norton: "…a type of malicious code or program written to alter the way a computer operates and that is designed to spread from one computer to another. A virus operates by inserting or attaching itself to a legitimate program or document that supports macros to execute its code. In the process, a virus has the potential to cause unexpected or damaging effects, such as harming the system software by corrupting or destroying data.”  
  
**VIRUS DEFINING TRAITS:** 
- Computer viruses must be invoked by a user.
- They insert themselves in or attach themselves to legitimate applications.
- They are designed to spread the infection to other applications and computers on the network.

**COMMON VIRUS TYPES:**   

- **RESIDENT VIRUS:**   
Propagates itself by infecting applications as they are opened by a user.  

- **NON-RESIDENT VIRUS:**   
Infects executable files when applications are not running.   

- **MULTIPARTITE VIRUS:**   
Uses multiple methods to infect and spread across computers. *(It typically remains in the computer’s memory to infect the hard disk, then spreads and infects more drives by altering the content of applications.)*  

- **DIRECT ACTION VIRUS:**   
Accesses a computer’s main memory and infects all applications, files, and folders located in the autoexec.bat path or the autostart registry path, before deleting itself.     
*(This virus typically alters the performance of a system and can destroy all data on the computer’s hard disk and any USB device attached to it.)*  

- **BROWSER HIJACKER:**   
Manually changes the settings of web browsers, such as replacing the homepage, editing the new tab page, and changing the default search engine. *(Technically, it is not a virus because it cannot infect files, but it can be hugely damaging to computer users, who often will not be able to restore their homepage or search engine. It can also contain adware that causes unwanted pop-up windows and ads.)*  

- **OVERWRITE VIRUSES:**  
Extremely dangerous. They can delete and replace data with their own file content or code. Once files are infected, they cannot be replaced, and the virus can affect Windows, DOS, Linux, and macOSsystems. The only way this virus can be removed is by deleting all the files it infected.

- **WEB SCRIPTING VIRUS:**  
Attacks web browser security, enabling a hacker to inject malicious code into web pages, or client-side scripting. Client-side scripting simply means running scripts, such as JavaScript, on the client device, usually within a browser. This allows cybercriminals to attack major websites, such as social networking sites, email providers, and any site that enables user input or reviews. Attackers can use the virus to send spam, commit fraudulent activity, and damage server files.

- **FILE INFECTOR:**  
One of the most common computer viruses. It overwrites files when they are opened and can quickly spread across systems and networks. It largely affects files with .exe or .com extensions.

- **NETWORK VIRUSES:**   
Extremely dangerous because they can completely cripple entire computer networks. They are often difficult to discover because the virus can hide on any computer on an infected network. These viruses can easily replicate and spread by using the internet, and transfer to devices connected to the network.  

- **BOOT SECTOR VIRUS:**   
Targets a computer’s master boot record (MBR). The virus injects its code into a hard disk’s partition table, then moves into the main memory when a computer restarts. 

---

Aside from viruses, there are other types of malware that do not share all the traits of a virus. *(For example, worm malware does not need a host system and can spread between systems and networks without user action, whereas a virus requires a user to execute its code.)*

**MALWARE THAT AREN'T VIRUSES:**

- **ROOTKIT:**   
A collection of computer software, typically malicious, designed to enable access to a computer or an area of its software that is not otherwise allowed. A rootkit often masks its existence or the existence of other software. It operates near or within the kernel of the operating system, but it cannot self-replicate or spread across systems.   

- **DLL INJECTION ATTACK:**   
Allows the attacker to execute malicious code by replacing legitimate DLL files with malicious ones. This type of attack is difficult to detect and prevent because it often involves the use of legitimate files and processes.    

- **DRIVER MANIPULATION ATTACK:**    
Changes or replaces driver software that allows the operating system to communicate with hardware devices.   

- **KEYLOGGER:**   
A computer program that records every keystroke made by a computer user, with the purpose of gaining fraudulent access to passwords and other confidential information. Keyloggers are a type of spyware, which is malware designed to spy on victims. Because they can capture everything you type, keyloggers are one of the most invasive forms of malware.   

- **(PUP) POTENTIALLY UNWANTED PROGRAM:**    
A program that may be unwanted, despite the possibility that a user consented to download it. PUPs include spyware, adware, and dialers, and are often downloaded in conjunctionwith a program that the user wants.   

- **SPYWARE:**     
Malware that obtains covert information about a user’s computer activities by transmitting data secretly from the hard drive. Spyware is a type of malware that collects personal information and gathers data about a user without consent.   

- **ADWARE:**    
A form of malware that hides on a device and displays ads. Some adware also monitors a user’s online behavior so it can target them with specific ads.   

- **DIALER:**    
A malicious program that is installed on a computer and tries to use the dialing features, often running up expensive phone bills for the victim. A dialer is unlike other types of spyware, though it is sometimes included with free software downloads.   

- **ADVERSARIAL MACHINE LEARNING:**    
A technique used in machine learning to fool or misguide a neural network with malicious input. Adversarial artificial intelligence uses specialized inputs created for the purpose of confusing a neural network, resulting in the misclassification of an input. These notorious inputs can be indistinguishable to the human eye but cause the network to fail to correctly identify an image.   

- **RANSOMWARE:**    
A type of virus that encrypts or prevents access to the information on a computer and restores access only after the user pays a ransom.   

- **TROJAN HORSE VIRUS:**    
A Virus disguised to look like something it is not. *(For example, viruses can be hidden within unofficial games, applications, file-sharing sites, and bootlegged movies.)*   

- **(RAT) REMOTE ACCESS TROJAN VIRUS:**    
Trojan malware that can remotely control an infected computer.   

- **DROPPER:**    
A type of Trojan horse that is designed to install malware on a computer. Once the dropper is installed, two things can happen: The dropper installs the embedded malware, or the dropper downloads the malware to the targeted computer.   

- **ROGUE SECURITY SOFTWARE / ROGUEWARE / SCAREWARE:**    
Misleads a user into believing that there is malware on their computer and then prompts them to pay for antimalware, which is either fake or malware.  

- **BOTNET MALWARE:**   
Controls its infected host through a command and control (C&C) server. An infected computer is named a *__bot__*, or *__robot__*, and a collection of infected computers is known as a *__botnet__*.   

- **CRYPTOJACKING:**    
The illegal use of computing resources to mine cryptocurrency. Attackers use malware or scripting to hijack a computer. *(For example, Coinhive was a cryptocurrency mining service that allowed website owners to embed JavaScript code on their websites, which hijacked the resources of connected computers for cryptomining purposes. This type of exploit is called __*in-browser mining.*__
