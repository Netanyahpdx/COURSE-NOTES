# LESSON 3: PRINCIPLES OF INFORMATION SECURITY   

#### Objectives of Information Security:  
**CIA TRIAD:**  
- **Confidentiality:** Data is kept private.  
- **Integrity:** Data is authentic, accurate, and free from tampering.  
- **Availability:** Data is accessible to those who need it.  

**DAD TRIAD** *(Opposite of CIA):*  
- **Disclosure:** Exposure of confidential data.  
- **Alteration:** Data tampered with or authenticity lost.  
- **Denial:** Preventing access to data.  

*Example Solution:* A network firewall can neutralize the DAD triad.
