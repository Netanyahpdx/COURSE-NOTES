# LESSON 1: INTRO  

# LESSON 2: WHAT IS CYBERSECURITY?  

**Cybersecurity**  
- Collective methods, technologies, and processes that protect computer systems, networks, and the information they contain.  
- Protects computer networks, devices, and information from damage, loss, or unauthorized access.  
- Focused on the preservation of **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability** (CIA) of information in cyberspace.  

**Role of Cybersecurity Professionals**  
- Protect servers, endpoints, databases, and networks by identifying security gaps and misconfigurations that create vulnerabilities.  

**5 Categories of Cybersecurity:**  
1. Critical Infrastructure  
2. Application Security  
3. Network Security  
4. Internet of Things (IoT) Security  
5. Cloud Security  

In addition to these, consider the **people and processes** that use technology to defend computer systems, networks, and information.

### WHY IS CYBERSECURITY IMPORTANT?  

Without securing computer networks, all technological advances are at risk. Examples include:  
- Critical Infrastructure  
- E-commerce  
- Data Storage and Computing Power  
- IoT  
- Remote Communication and Collaboration

### INFORMATION SECURITY AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS SECURITY  

**Information Security (InfoSec):**  
- The practice of protecting information, both digital and physical.  
- Involves preventing, detecting, and remediating threats to sensitive information.  
- Includes tools, processes, and documentation of threats and systems.  
- Examples: Mission-critical data, HR policies, legal contracts.  

**Categorizing Information:**  
1. **Unprotected:** No controls necessary.  
2. **Protected:** Requires rigorous controls based on sensitivity:  
   - Confidential  
   - Secret  
   - Top Secret  

**Information Systems Security (a subset of InfoSec):**  
- Protects information systems from unauthorized access, modification, destruction, or denial of access to authorized users.  
- Includes devices, networks, and physical locations storing or transmitting sensitive information.  

**Hierarchy:**  
`Information Security > Information Systems Security > Cybersecurity`

### FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE AND PRECAUTIONS  

1. **Educating People:**  
   - Human error is a leading cause of breaches.  
   - Teach users to identify phishing and avoid risky behaviors.  

2. **Prepare for Disaster & Plan for Recovery:**  
   - Regular backups stored safely offline minimize data loss and interruptions.

### KNOWLEDGE CHECK:  

1. **What is cybersecurity?**  
   - The protection of computing devices and digital information.  

2. **Which two actions are recommended as a first line of defense against cyberattacks?**  
   - Prepare for disaster and plan for recovery.  
   - Educate yourself about cybersecurity.
