# POTENTIAL IMPACT OF SECURITY VULNERABILITIES

Security vulnerabilities can have serious consequences if not addressed properly. The impact depends on the vulnerability type and the attackerâ€™s goals. Key impacts include:

- **Unauthorized Access** to sensitive data
- **Disruption of Services**
- **Damage to Reputation**

## The CIA Triad

Understanding the CIA triad is essential for application security. It provides a framework for implementing security measures to protect data and services:

- **Confidentiality**: Ensures only authorized users can access data.
- **Integrity**: Ensures the data is accurate and reliable.
- **Availability**: Ensures data is accessible when needed.

By focusing on the CIA triad, secure applications can be built to protect both users and organizations.
