# INTRODUCTION TO INSECURE SESSION MANAGEMENT 

Insecure Session Management is a vulnerability that occurs when a web application fails to properly secure and manage user sessions. A session is a temporary interaction between a user and a web application, maintained using session tokens (unique identifiers).

## Risks of Insecure Session Management

- **Unauthorized Access**
- **Session Hijacking**
- **Compromise of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability**

## Causes of Insecure Session Management

- Weak session token generation
- Improper storage or transmission of session tokens
- Lack of session timeouts
- Ineffective session termination

## Prevention Measures

- Use secure algorithms for session token generation
- Ensure HTTPS is used for transmission
- Implement secure cookie attributes
- Regularly validate and expire session tokens

By following these practices, developers can reduce the risks and enhance the security of user sessions.
