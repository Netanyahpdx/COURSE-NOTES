# Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)

IDOR is a common security vulnerability that occurs when an application exposes direct access to internal objects (e.g., files, database records) without proper access control. This can allow unauthorized users to access, modify, or delete sensitive data, causing severe consequences.

## Causes of IDOR Vulnerabilities

- **Insufficient or Improper Access Controls**: When resources are referenced by URL parameters, form fields, or user-controlled inputs without proper access restrictions.
  
## Exploitation of IDOR

- Attackers can manipulate inputs to gain unauthorized access to resources, potentially compromising data integrity and security.
