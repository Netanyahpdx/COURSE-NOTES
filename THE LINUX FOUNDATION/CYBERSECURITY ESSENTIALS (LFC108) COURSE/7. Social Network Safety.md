# The more detail we share online, the easier it is to hack into someone’s digital profile.

The more we reuse passwords on multiple platforms, the faster our identity can be stolen.

Think of this as leaving a key to your home with an address everywhere you visit.

## Standard disclosures we share should not include the following:

- **Date of birth**  
  Date of birth is usually pre-set to yes on social media platforms.

- **City of birth**  
  The birth city is usually pre-set to yes on social media platforms.

- **Maiden name(s)**  
  Are you friends with family members who disclose their maiden names online? This is usually a password standard for online accounts.

- **Current address, city, or both**  
  Have you invited people to any activities at your home that includes specific details about where you live?

- **Phone number or email address**

- **Social Security, passport, or driver's license numbers**

- **Bank, loan, or credit card information**

- **School, family, or work information**

- **Car information**

# Personal Identification Information & Social Networking (Continued)

With so much data easily attainable online, what can we do to ensure a safe digital experience?

The first step in Cybersecurity Awareness is to protect your PII.

Think about your Facebook or related social media profile. Have you ever manually changed Settings to minimize public disclosure of PII?

## Steps to Protect Your PII:

- **Only volunteer information that is vital for social media use**
- **Never post about your birthdate** and turn off social reminders.
- **Never post your home address.** Sometimes cybercriminals work with physical thieves that target homes, workplaces, and cars and watch movements like stalkers.
- **Minimize the information you can see** if the viewer is not a connection.
- **Do not provide “check-ins”** of your whereabouts during business or personal trips.

Most social media companies have a “Help” and “User Settings” section. With just a few simple changes, you can secure your online digital footprint. Start by locking down what people can see if they are not connected to you.

Think about hiding your birthdate, town, connections, and cell phone number, which is used to validate your accounts and likely part of the information shared online.

# Don’t Reveal Location

This seems like an issue of common sense, and yet many people must be reminded that revealing their location to strangers is never a good idea.

Some social media sites require that you input your location. If that’s the case, you can use your creativity to make a fake location or input a city/state different from where you are.

Sometimes, the website will allow you to continue without entering anything in the location field.

The Internet is a public source, and disclosing your location to strangers could expose you to crime, including burglary, harassment, or stalking.

# Keep Birthdate Hidden

Giving away your birthdate seems harmless, but with your birthdate, hackers have one of the several pieces of information needed to steal your identity.

If you absolutely must list your birthdate, **do not include the year**.

# Have a Private Profile

Just because you post something doesn’t mean it’s for everybody to see.

Although social media is a valuable way of networking professionally and promoting your business or resume, failing to manage your profile and privacy settings properly could have consequences you cannot undo.

Every social media platform has instructions for updating your profile settings to distribute information according to your settings. Be sure to read through these guidelines thoroughly.

Some common social media websites include:

- Facebook
- Instagram
- Twitter
- TikTok
- Google+
- LinkedIn
- Pinterest

# Don’t Link Accounts

Although linking social media accounts may be a convenience to you, it makes it easier for thieves to find you. **Do not link your personal accounts with your work accounts.**

Some content on one of your social media sites may not be appropriate for content on another site.

For example, the content you post on Facebook, a relatively informal site, may not be suitable for your LinkedIn account, which is a more formal setting.

Other reasons you shouldn’t link your social media accounts include:

- Automated posting
- Same messages across different platforms
- Increased risk of identity theft
- A more likely chance of receiving spam in inbox (which can be malware and/or viruses)
- Password reuse can export multiple accounts

- Update your software regularly

# Be Wary of the Software and Applications You Install

While desktop and mobile apps may seem fun, be cautious, especially when using work-issued devices. Even apps from trusted stores (Google, Microsoft, Apple) don't guarantee security. Unauthorized apps can compromise privacy, Intellectual Property (IP), and may even expose your company’s network to malware.

**Risks of Installing Apps:**

- Apps can monitor, record, or allow hackers direct access to your system.
- Social media and online services may install trackers that collect personal data (IP address, location, browsing activity).
- Trackers can often be deleted but may still be used for data harvesting.

**Best Practices:**

- Only install authorized apps on work devices.
- Be cautious with personal devices connected to workplace infrastructure.
- Understand where apps come from and what happens to your data.
- Balance enjoyment with personal data safety when installing apps.
