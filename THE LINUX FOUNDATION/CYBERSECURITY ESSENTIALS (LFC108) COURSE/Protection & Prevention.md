# PROTECTION & PREVENTION

**PASSWORD ATTACKS**
Passwords serve as the first line of defense in preventing unauthorized access to your accounts.

Using strong passwords to prevent threats against the privacy and security of the data associated with your information, your company, and your customers are necessary to achieve password security and, thus, information security.

Hackers have software that will crack easy passwords within seconds.

Using easy-to-guess passwords or the same password for multiple accounts allows hackers to test and illegally gain access to your accounts.

Simple and common passwords can enable the hacker to steal from your bank accounts, obtain health records, and infiltrate your social media accounts.

**HOW TO PROTECT YOUR DATA - CRAFTING STRONG PASSWORDS**  
  
DOS:  
  
- Create a password that is easy for you to remember but difficult for someone else to figure out
- Use a unique password for each of your accounts
- Use at least 12 characters containing upper case, lower case, numbers and symbols
- Example: OurPass*7#Hi
- Change your password regularly
- Change default usernames and passwords
- New software can come with default Usernames (UN) and Passwords (PW) (UN: Admin / PW: password123), which are an open door for any hacker to find and use against you.
- Have a secure backup method to retrieve passwords
- Write them down and securely store them in a safe or drawer that requires a key
- Password protect a USB drive with the master password file
- Invest in a password manager service
  
DONT'S:  
- Use generic phrases or personal information as your password.
- Example: your last name, birthday, street address, or "abc12345"
- Use the same password for multiple accounts
- Use common words or consecutive characters to make up your password
- Example: do not use "password" as your password or use a password such as Office111.
- Share your username or passwords with family, friends or co-workers
- Save passwords on your phone
- Save passwords on or in an unlocked device
- DON’T SACRIFICE SECURITY for CONVENIENCE!

**STEPS TO CREATING & REMEMBERING PASSWORDS**     
 
  3-step method to create and remember passwords  
  
1. Choose a Phrase  
First, choose a phrase that you know well—like a line from a song. For example, from Somewhere Over the Rainbow: "Someday I'll wish upon a star and wake up where the clouds are far behind me."  
  
2. Use the First Letter of Each Word  
Next, take the first letter of each word in your chosen phrase. In our example, "Someday I'll wish upon a star and wake up where the clouds are far behind me" would become "siwuasawuwtcafbm."  
  
3. Replace Some Letters  
Finally, strategically replace some letters with numbers, characters, or capitalized letters. To continue the "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" password, you could replace "siwuasawuwtcafbm" with "&iWu@&@WuWt6@fb2."  
  
In this example, there were easy-to-remember changes, like:  
- Changing instances of the letter S to ampersands (&)
- Capitalizing each W
- Changing instances of the letter A to @ signs
- Choosing two words (in this case, clouds and me) and replacing them with the number of letters in the words (6, 2)

**MULTIFACTOR AUTHENTICATION**  
  
"Well, this is annoying," Janelle thinks as she attempts to log in to her bank account from a new phone. She's already entered her username and password, plus she answered a security question about her father's middle name.  
  
Now the app wants to send an SMS code to verify her identity. She accepts the text on her cell phone, enters the number, and opens her account.  
  
SHE IS CONFIDENT HER INFORMATION IS SECURE!  
  
This process may seem cumbersome, but these security layers—called Multifactor Authentication (MFA) or two-step verification—help keep Janelle safe from cybercriminals.  
  
MFA allows you to protect your data through various layers.
  
MFA is a way of authenticating an individual's identity using two components before they gain access. The idea behind this process is that although an imposter has one piece of the victim's identifying information, they most likely don't have two.  
  
Instead of merely protecting your account with a username and password, you also obtain verification through phone, email, text, or specialized PIN numbers. Even if someone gets your password, they still won't be able to access the account without having access to your MFA information.  
  
Examples of information that can be used for authentication purposes include:  
- SMS code
- Text code
- Token
- Key
- Password
- Pin
- Fingerprint
- Voice recognition

**DOWNLOAD ATTACHMENTS WITH CARE**

IF YOU RECEIVE AN ATTACHMENT IN AN EMAIL AND YOU WERE NOT EXPECTING IT, check for potential security risks first—even if the email appears to be from a credible source.  
 
Although the attachment may have what seems to be a well-known extension, for example a .PDF, .docx, or .pptx, it could be a Trojan Horse.  
 
Malicious attachments and links are two of the most common ways hackers manipulate victims into downloading malware.

Cybercriminals disguise their intent by posing as a friend, trusted business, or new opportunity. Protect yourself by checking the source.

DONT'S:
- Never open email file attachments sent by someone you don't know.
- Even if you know the sender, confirm their email address matches the real deal before opening a file. A hacker's email may look similar to a real person or business. 
- Beware of generic but enticing messages like "Check this out,” "Is this you?" or "You’ve got to try this.” 
- Question the sender's intentions when you receive an unsolicited email to visit a particular website. 
- Use another method to contact the sender to verify if they sent you the attachment.

**REDUCE COMMON RISKY BROWSING HABITS** 

Reduce Common Risky Browsing Habits  
  
Browsing the web has become such a part of our lives that we often don’t think twice about typing, clicking, and entering sensitive personal information online. However, trusting our luck can have severe consequences.  
  
### COMMON BROWSING HABIRS THAT CAN LEAD TO A DANGER INCLUDE:  
   
#### IGNORING SECURITY UPDATES      
Applications, software, and devices offer regular updates to address bugs, improve performance, and patch security vulnerabilities.    
*Solution**: Prioritize these security updates to keep yourself safe online.  
  
#### USING BROWSER AUTO FILLS     
Another unsafe habit is relying on browser auto-fills for personal information like contact and banking details. Letting your browser memorize sensitive data is tempting since it's easy. However, once your device ends up in the wrong hands, all your personal information can be stolen and used.  
**Solution**: Say “no thanks” to auto-fills. Use a secure password manager instead.   
  
#### NOT CLEARING BROWSING HISTORY & COOKIE 
Browsing history and cookies are fodder for hackers to launch phishing attacks by impersonating contacts or masquerading as familiar companies asking for personal information.  
**Solution**: Use the incognito mode on your browser to reduce your risk when entering sensitive information or set your browser to erase browsing and cookie history when you shut down. Example: DuckDuckGo  
    
#### STAYING LOGGED IN TO WEBSITES
We often think it’s safe if we close the browser and don’t bother logging out from secure websites with our sensitive information. However, doing so leaves us at risk of physical and cyberattacks.  
**Solution**: Always actively log out of a secure website instead of simply closing the window.

# SAFEST WAY TO USE PUBLIC WIFI
  
Public Wi-Fi networks are less secure and more vulnerable to attack than private Wi-Fi. Never enter private data when using public Wi-Fi. 
  
- Use a secure virtual private network (VPN) in public areas to protect information.  
- Remember to shield your screen from shoulder surfers when entering sensitive information.  
- Use the best practices to increase your safety when in a café, hotel, or other public space.  


### BEST PRACTICES FOR USING PUBLIC WIFI  
  
#### CONNECT TO A SECURE NETWORK   
Not all networks are created equal. Choose official networks, preferably secured with a password.  
  
#### USE A VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORK (VPN)  
VPNs encrypt your data while you’re connected—even on an unsecured network. Many employees can use a corporate VPN, but private VPNs are also available for free or as a paid service. Just check reviews before you commit.  
  
#### ONLY ACCESS SECURE SITES  
It’s always important to steer clear of sites that do not include an “S” after HTTP, but even more so on public Wi-Fi. Don’t risk it. Look for HTTPS URLs to ensure connections are encrypted and private—no exceptions.   

#### DON'T ACCESS SENSITIVE INFORMATION ON PUBLIC WIFI      
Save banking, shopping, social media, and remote work accounts for safer networks. Don’t give criminals a chance to capture sensitive data!  
  
#### GUARD YOUR PHYSICAL SPACE    
Pay attention to your surroundings, and don’t leave devices unattended. Consider a privacy screen to make it harder for others to view or photograph personal information.  
  
#### DON'T FORGET TO LOG OUT   
Confirm that you’ve signed out of all sites you accessed. As an extra precaution, configure settings to forget the Wi-Fi network so you won’t connect unless you intend to.   
  
### ALTERNATIVES TO PUBLIC WIFI  
If the networks available to you feel unsafe, consider the following alternatives:    
#### PERSONAL HOTSPOT   
A personal hotspot is your own private, secure network connection. You can often connect to your phone’s hotspot using cellular data and battery. Or you can buy a separate mobile device to connect to your hotspot.  
#### CELLULAR NETWORK
You can also use your phone to connect to the Internet directly through your cellular network. In general, cellular data is safer than an unsecured Wi-Fi connection.
