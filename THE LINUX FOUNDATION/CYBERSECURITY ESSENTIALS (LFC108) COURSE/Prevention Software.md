Antivirus Software protects users from many different threats. These include viruses, browser helper objects (BHOs) or browser hijackers, rootkits, Trojan Horses, worms, and ransomware. Antivirus software should automatically look for trouble in the background. Think of it like installing a security alarm at your house – it alerts you when intruders are in the system.

- For your personal computer, use products that offer the right level of protection.
- At work, refer to your helpdesk for information.

#### Anti-Spyware Software

Anti-Spyware Software aims to detect and dispose of spyware programs that users don’t intend to have on their systems. These spyware programs are installed on the computer without the user’s knowledge or consent and collect information about them. Spyware can cause damage by posing a security risk and reducing system performance.

**Examples of companies that offer Antivirus/Anti-Spyware programs include:**
- McAfee
- Kaspersky
- Bitdefender
- Norton

**HOW TO PROTECT YOUR DATA**

#### RUN UP-TO-DATE ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE

Does your computer notify you when you need a software update? As cumbersome as they seem, updates protect against potential security breaches by addressing vulnerabilities.

#### INSTALL THE DATA
Are you on a Windows machine? Do you run Microsoft Security or a third-party software such as McAfee, Bitdefender, or other commercially available antivirus software? If your antivirus software isn't updated, then you are not protected from the most recent vulnerabilities.

When your computer tells you it’s time to update Windows or your cell phone says an update is available, update that device sooner rather than later. Hackers will find vulnerabilities in all software, and patches or updates are responses to these vulnerabilities.

To ensure your Antivirus/Anti-Spyware programs are working correctly, be sure to regularly update your settings and run scheduled scans to check for anything suspicious.

#### ROUTINE UPDATES
Operating systems periodically release updates to address security issues and improve computer performance.

The 3 categories that these fall into are:
- **High Priority**: These updates are critical and should be non-negotiable. Examples of such updates include security patches and bug fixes.
- **Suggested**: These updates can help improve the performance of your computer but, typically, do not result in significant problems if not installed.
- **Drivers**: These updates provide improved or enhanced information to maintain the performance of installed applications on the operating system.
