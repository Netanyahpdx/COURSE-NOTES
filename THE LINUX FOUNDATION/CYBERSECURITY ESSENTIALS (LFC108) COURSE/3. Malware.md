# MALWARE

Malware is a type of software designed to cause harm to computer systems, networks, or devices. The term "malware" is short for "malicious software." Malware can take many forms, including *viruses, worms, Trojan horses, ransomware, spyware, and adware.*

Malware can disrupt regular system and network operations, steal sensitive information (e.g., passwords and business data), or install hidden remote access, allowing unauthorized access to a system.

### PROTECTING AGAINST MALWARE
- Keep software up-to-date.
- Use antivirus software.
- Practice safe browsing habits.
- Be cautious when downloading software or opening email attachments, as these are common vectors for malware infection.

## TYPES OF MALWARE 

### **Worms**
A computer worm is an independent malware program that reproduces itself to infect other computers. Worms spread without attaching to an existing program and can damage networks.

**Damage from Worms:**
- Bandwidth consumption
- Stopping active anti-malware services
- Immobilizing Safe Mode
- Hindering operating system auto-updates

**What Worms Can Do:**
- Cause significant damage by consuming network bandwidth, slowing performance, and compromising sensitive information.
- Spread rapidly, posing a major threat to computer security.
- Exploit vulnerabilities in operating systems or software for unauthorized access.

**Protection Against Worms:**
- Keep software up-to-date.
- Use firewalls.
- Practice safe browsing habits.
- Use antivirus software and intrusion detection systems.

### **Viruses**
A virus is a type of malicious software that replicates itself and infects other programs or files on a computer. Viruses typically spread by attaching to legitimate programs or files and can spread when these files are shared or run on other systems.

**Damage from Viruses:**
- Corrupting files
- Slowing down computers
- Taking over essential operating system functions

**What Viruses Can Do:**
- Slow performance
- Steal sensitive information
- Destroy data
- Be used in broader attacks like distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks

---

### **Spyware**
Spyware is designed to obtain information about an individual or company without their knowledge or consent. It is often installed by downloading infected software or opening malicious email attachments.

---

### **Trojan Horse**
A Trojan horse disguises itself as a legitimate program or file. Unlike viruses, Trojans don’t replicate but hide within seemingly harmless programs to execute malicious activities.

---

### **Ransomware**
Ransomware encrypts a victim's files, locking users out of their systems. Attackers demand a ransom in exchange for a decryption key.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Files may be lost permanently if the ransom isn't paid.
- There is no guarantee of recovery even if payment is made.
- Ransomware attacks can be costly due to ransom payments or data recovery efforts.

**Common Infection Methods:**
- Phishing emails
- Infected software downloads
- Exploiting system vulnerabilities

**Protection Against Ransomware:**
- Keep software up-to-date.
- Use firewalls.
- Practice safe browsing habits.
- Regularly back up important data.

---

### **Adware**
Adware displays unwanted advertisements on a user’s computer. It often comes bundled with free software and can be difficult to detect or remove.

**What Adware Can Do:**
- Display pop-up ads
- Redirect web pages
- Alter search results
- Slow down computer performance
- Compromise sensitive information

**Protection Against Adware:**
- Use antivirus software.
- Keep software up-to-date.
- Use firewalls.
- Practice safe downloading habits.
- Back up important data.
- Be cautious before downloading software or opening email attachments.
